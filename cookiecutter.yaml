    <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/">Hackweeks</a> are participant-driven events that strive to create
    welcoming spaces for participants to learn new things, build community and
    gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science.
    </br></br>
    The 2023 GeoSmart Hackweek will focus primarily on project work, with an emphasis on applications in Hydrology and Cryosphere science. 
    Project ideas will be shared in advance. 
    There will be space for new ideas to emerge during the Hackweek based on participant engagement. 
    We will provide about 5 hours of data science tutorials spread over the week, including space for participant-led tutorials. 
    </br></br>
    During the week, participants will have the opportunity to collaborate with
    their peers, share ideas, and work on projects leading to exciting results and
    discoveries. This event is open to all experience levels in machine learning
    knowledge, so whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, you're
    welcome to join. However, to benefit most from the event, prior knowledge of
    Python programming and data handling using common Python packages (pandas,
    xarray, etc.) is desired. See the event Jupyter book for more details. 
    </br></br>
    Preliminary project ideas include streamflow prediction from SAR-derived snowmelt timing or snow data, predicting snow water equivalent with machine learning, glacier dh/dt from DEMs using geospatial time series analysis, derivation of snow covered areas from satellite imagery, derivation of snow depth from SAR backscatter and lidar-derived snow data, predicting river discharge from seismic waves and others! Join one of these projects or pitch your own project idea at the event!
